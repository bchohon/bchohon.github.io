                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Sister company of online medical apparel retailer allheart.com, allheart<i>chefs</i>.com is a budding eCommerce store focused on the nich&eacute; market of chef apparel, cutlery, and kitchen accessories. The base wireframe layout is the exact same as allheart.com to maintain brand consistency as well as promote ease of internal maintenance between the two different web holdings. The home page advertises current promotions and offers consumers a number of ways to begin shopping, including: a search box, product list filtering, the daily deal, and a tabbed group of products.</p>

                    <h3>Nav Menu</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The main navigation is presented as a horizontal drop down menu that features icons for the top five most popular categories, text links for all pertaining subcategories and subsections, and a space for optional promotional banners.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Section Page</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The section page serves as the product sort page, where consumers can refine their product selection by sorting and filtering on options related to the items on the page. Item-specific filtering options include: Brand, Style, Size, Color, and Price.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                    <h3>Section Page (Alternate)</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The longterm vision for the section page is to change the vertical side refinements to a horizontal orientation, which could then be pinned at the top of the screen when the user scrolls down the page. The new format would also allow more products to be shown above the fold as well as on the greater page.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Section Page (Quick View UI)</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The section page quick view link launches an abridged version of the product page in a new popup window; everything required to purchase the item is included in the interface, while less important peripheral content such as product reviews and recently viewed is omitted. The quick view interface is optimal for returning consumers who already know what they want and/or users who wish to purchase multiple items from the same section page.</p>

                </li>

                    <h3>Section Page (Quick View UI - Personalization)</h3>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>A number of products allow for optional embroidery and/or emblem personalization. Once the personalization selector is changed to &quot;Yes&quot;, the personalization interface takes over the popup modal and presents users with available personalization options as well as a live preview. A simple JavaScript function invoked by the onkeyup event powers the real-time preview page manipulation.</p>
