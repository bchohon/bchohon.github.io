Vector graphics are comprised of paths, which are defined by a start point and an end point, that can be scaled to a larger size without loss of image quality. The red apple is an example of a complex vector illustration, which offers the illusion of a realistic photograph but still retains the freedom to infinitely resize as needed. This piece was created as the accompanying image for a company's popular event series."
